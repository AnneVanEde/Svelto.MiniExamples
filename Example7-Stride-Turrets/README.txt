This awkward miniexample doesn't give justice to Stride, but it's enough for learning purposes. It's goals are:

- Showing how to use Svelto.ECS with a different engine than Unity
- Showing how to handle hierarchical transformation explicitly (just one of the possible ways to do so)
- Showing a simple example of correct code abstractions (more to come with my new article about this)

You can't really do much, I decided to not complete the demo to something meaningful because each new feature wouldn't add anything to the purpose of the example itself.
You can move the main character with WASD.

You need to download stride to run this project, You can install Stride from https://stride3d.net/
