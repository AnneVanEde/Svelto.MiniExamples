First Svelto.ECS-Task example.

Please note, at the time of writing:

* It uses a beta version of Svelto.ECS 2.8. When it's out of beta it will be available in the official repository
* It uses an alpha and not feature complete version of Svelto.Tasks 2.0. When it's out of alpha it will be available in the official repository
* I didn't want to show the use of implementors in this first example, so It uses Unity ECS as renderer framework

Instructions:

these doofuses do not reproduce, they spawn! And they are hungry! Feed them dropping food with the left mouse button or they will die. No limit on the food to spawn, it's not a game :).
Pushing left CTRL will unlock the mouse.
