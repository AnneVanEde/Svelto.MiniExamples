## Example 1:

![Image](https://github.com/sebas77/GithubWikiImages/blob/master/Example1-Doofuses.gif)

Object-less pure ECS example that shows the basics of Svelto.ECS and Svelto.Tasks.

* Goal of this example: show the simplest use of Svelto 2.8 (beta state), intoduce to the concept of entity descriptors, entity structs and groups. 
* Secondary goal: show integration with UnityECS, show the use of Svelto.Tasks 2.0 (alpha state), show integration with Burst

* **Iteration 1: Example1-DoofusesMustEat (done):**
  * Integration with UnityECS for rendering
  * Move the camera with arrows and mouse, left button to drop food
* **Iteration 2: Example1B-DoofusesMustEatBurst (done):**
  * Integration with Burst for better performance
  * Move the camera with arrows and mouse, left button to drop 100 random food only once
* **Iteration 3 (to do):**
  * Enable Svelto.Tasks multithreading for better performance
* **Iteration 4 (to do):**
  * Something I will say later
  
## Example 2: To do

Integration with Unity GameObjects and Monobehaviours. Uses Svelto ECS 2.0 (beta) and Svelto Tasks 1.5

* Goal of this example: show the integration with OOP platforms (Unity in this case) throught the use of Entity View Structs and implementors.
